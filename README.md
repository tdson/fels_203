## Getting started

To get started with the app, after clone the repo:

First, you'll need to copy `database.yml` to run the app, just copy and rename `config/database.example.yml`:

```
mv /config/database.example.yml /config/database.yml
```

Then, the application needs gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Then, run the server

```
$ rails server
```

Weâ€™ll be resizing images using the image manipulation program ImageMagick,
which we need to install on the development environment.

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install imagemagick --fix-missing
```
